# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Paste
The Paste Manager App is a React-based web app for managing and organizing text snippets ("pastes"). It lets users add, edit, delete, copy, search, and share pastes with ease. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, it's perfect for developers, students, or anyone working frequently with text content.
